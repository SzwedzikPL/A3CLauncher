# A3C Launcher
[Arma3Coop.pl](https://arma3coop.pl) community game launcher for Windows.  
Application is based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

## Purpose (planned - in development)
Launcher is mainly used to simplify management of Arma 3 mods used by our community.
It can also be useful in creating scenarios and other game-oriented tasks.

To use launcher you need to be registered community member.
For that reason application is developed only for Polish-speaking users.
